# Temperature Sensor
* A temperature sensor creates a changing voltage signal depending on the temperature it senses. It has three pins: one that connects to ground, another that connects to 5 volts, and a third that outputs a variable voltage to your Arduino, similar to the analog signal from a potentiometer.

## Code Explanation
* Firstly, we use `Serial.begin(9600)` function to display the temperature in celsius and fahrenheit on the Serial Monitor.
* We have used many if blocks in our program to check the temperature and glow the bulbs accordingly, in order to inform us about the estimate temperature
* You can also [click here](https://github.com/tb-rules10/Ardutronics/blob/branch-1/Scripts/Temperature%20Sensor/Code.ino) to check the code.
