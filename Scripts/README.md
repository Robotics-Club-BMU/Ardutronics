# Scripts 

The Arduino microcontroller has a nearly limitless array of innovative applications for everything from robotics and lighting, to games and gardening! This folder contains the scripts, which are more or less shorter than projects, and often just contain a single code.ino file for the actual code, and they can be included in your big projects


This folder is basically a collection of scripts made using Arduino Board.

# Table of Contents

Sr. No.             |   Name               |   Small Description               
:------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
**1.**              | [**7 Segment Display**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/7%20Segment%20Display)  | A script to loop through numbers 0 to 9 on a seven segment display
**2.**              | [**BLINKING LED**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/BLINKING_LED) | This is a simple script which consists of a simple blinking led, which is connected via the pin number 13, and the delay between each blink can be increased or decreased using the serial communication
**3.**              | [**Multiple LEDs Blinking**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/BlinkingLEDS) | A code to to have multiple LEDs blink, and at different intervals of time, and the code is totally dynamic
**4.**              | [**Controlling motors using IR remote**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/ControlMotorsWithIR) | A very basic script to control motors witht the help of an IR remote and IR sensor
**5.**              | [**Fading LED**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/Fading%20LED) | Fading effect for a LED
**6.**              | [**Light Sensor (Photoresistor)**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/Light%20Sensor) | Photoresistors, also known as light dependent resistors (LDR), are light sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very high, sometimes up to 1 MÎ©, but when the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance drops dramatically, even down to a few ohms, depending on the light intensity.
**7.**              | [**PIR Sensor**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/PIR%20Sensor) | A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications. They sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved.
**8.**              | [**Potentiometer**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/Potentiometer) | A Potentiometer is a simple knob that provides a variable resistance, which we can read into the Arduino board as an analog value. In this example, that value controls the rate at which an LED blinks. We connect three wires to the Arduino board. The first goes to ground from one of the outer pins of the potentiometer. The second goes from 5 volts to the other outer pin of the potentiometer. The third goes from analog input 2 to the middle pin of the potentiometer.
**9.**              | [**Push Button Counter**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/PushBTNCounter) | A simple script to count the number of button pushes, and if the button is pressed for more than 2 seconds, it resets the count, and display on LCD screen
**10.**              | [**RGB LED - Colour Mixing**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/RGB%20Colour%20Mixing) | This is a simple project which makes an RGB Led glow in different colours.
**11.**              | [**Sliding text on a LCD**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/SlidingTextOnLcd) | For this particular script, what we did is, take a given a string, and then use an algorthim to shift everything to left, and display that on the lcd, every single time, after 150ms. For example, if the string text="123456" it would change that to "234561", but that wouldn't make the text appear sliding, so, whenever you set the text from the serial monitor, and if the text is less than 16, it would just add whitespaces to the text.
**12.**              | [**Temperature Sensor**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/Temperature%20Sensor) | A temperature sensor creates a changing voltage signal depending on the temperature it senses. It has three pins: one that connects to ground, another that connects to 5 volts, and a third that outputs a variable voltage to your Arduino, similar to the analog signal from a potentiometer.
**13.**              | [**Ultrasonic Sensor controlled Led & Buzzer**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/Ultrasonic%20Sensor%20controlled%20Buzzerd) | The given circuit is a demonstration of an Ultrasonic Sensor controlled Led & Buzzer
**14.**              | [**Traffic controller for four streets**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/traffic_controller_for_streets) |This is a basic traffic controller written for four streets' intersection
**15.**              | [**TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER**](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-BMU/Ardutronics/tree/main/Scripts/traffic_lights) |A basic traffic light controller, consits of three leds, on pin numbers 0, 1, 2, with colors, red, yellow, and green respectively.
