# 7 Segment Display
* A 7-segment display consists of seven LEDs (hence its name) arranged in a rectangular fashion as shown.
* This is a project in which displays numbers 0 to 9 nine on a 7-segment display.

## Code Explanation
* First of all, we neet to set the resistor value at 500 Î© & set 7-segment display as anode.
* In the code, we have made ten different functions to display 10 different numbers, where we are using the digitalWrite() function accordingly.
* At last, we have void loop(void) function to display a number by calling other functions at a time interval of 1 second.
