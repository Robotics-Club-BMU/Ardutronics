# Fading LED

* This is a simple circuit where i've passed a code which will give fading effect to an LED.

## Code Explanation
 
 * In the code, i've just used two for loops, one will increase the intensity of an LED from Low to High while another one will decrease the intensity of LED from High 
 to Low at a time interval of 0.5 seconds, hence adding a fading effect to glowing led.
