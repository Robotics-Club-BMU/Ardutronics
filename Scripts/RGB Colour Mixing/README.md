# RGB LED - Colour Mixing
* This is a simple project which makes an RGB Led glow in different colours.

## Code Explanation
* I've just connected 3 terminals of  RGB Led with pins 11, 12 & 13 and the 4th terminal to ground.
* In the code, random() function is used to store randoms colours for Led and make it glow in different colours.
