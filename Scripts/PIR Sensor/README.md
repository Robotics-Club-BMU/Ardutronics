# PIR Sensor

* A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view.
* PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications. They sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved.

## Code Explanation

* Firstly, we use `Serial.begin(9600)` function to display the output on the Serial Monitor.
* We read the input given by PIR Sensor to Arduino using `digitalRead(11)` and then display it.
