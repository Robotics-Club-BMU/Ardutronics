# Ultrasonic Sensor controlled Led & Buzzer
* The given circuit is a demonstration of an Ultrasonic Sensor controlled Led & Buzzer

## Code Explanation
* The Ultrasonic sensor sends a pulse to the sensor to initiate a reading, then listens for a pulse to return. The length of the returning pulse is proportional to the distance of the object from the sensor.
