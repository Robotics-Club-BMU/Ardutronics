# **Arduino and its types**

*[Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) is an open-source platform used to make electronics projects. It consists of both a microcontroller and a part of the software or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that runs on your PC, used to write & upload computer code to the physical board. The platform of an Arduino has become very famous with designers or students just starting out with electronics, and for an excellent cause.*

## Types of Arduino Boards

Unlike most earlier programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not require a separate part of hardware in order to program a new code onto the board you can just use a USB cable. As well, the Arduino IDE uses a basic version of C++, making it simpler to learn the program. At last, the Arduino board offers a typical form factor that breaks out the functions of the microcontroller into a more available package.

## Why Arduino Boards?

Arduino board has been used for making different engineering projects and different applications. The Arduino software is very simple to use for beginners, yet flexible adequate for advanced users. It runs Windows, Linux, and Mac. Teachers and students in the schools utilize it to design low-cost scientific instruments to verify the principles of physics and chemistry. There are numerous other microcontroller platforms obtainable for physical computing. The Netmedia’s BX-24, Parallax Basic Stamp, MIT’s Handyboard, Phidget, and many others present related functionality.

Arduino also makes simpler the working process of microcontroller, but it gives some advantages over other systems for teachers, students, and beginners.
