## Theory

Arduino is a project, open-source hardware, and software platform used to design and build electronic devices. It designs and manufactures microcontroller kits and single-board interfaces for building electronics projects.
The Arduino boards were initially created to help the students with the non-technical background.
The designs of Arduino boards use a variety of controllers and microprocessors.

This folder maily focuses on the theory related stuff about Arduino Board.
