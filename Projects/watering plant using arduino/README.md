# Watering plants using Arduino

In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the
moisture level of the soil. If soil will get dry then
sensor senses low moisture level and automatically
switches on the water pump to supply water to the
plant. As plant get sufficient water and soil get wet
then sensor senses enough moisture in soil. After
which the water pump will automatically get stopped.

Here, using an IR sensor, the moisture of the soil is recorded, and if the temperature is high, then the plant is watered and "the soil is dry " message is also sent to the user ia a GSM module . Also the condition of the soil, the current temperature, and the notification of msg sent to user is printed on the LCD. It is controlled by a potentiometer , used to alternate the voltages of the LCD , to display the output based on different input signals .
Different resistors & transistors are also used to control the flow of current through the devices connected; & to alternate the voltages & currents for various appliances , also an SPDT relay ,which is  used  to control high power application through low power signal electronic circuits , is also used here to prevent short circuit.
