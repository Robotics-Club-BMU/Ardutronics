# Arduino piano circuit

## ***Objective:***
To create a paino-like musical instrument using arduino.
Here we would push-buttons & a buzzer to give input & output resp.On pressing the buttons, sounds of different tones would be played from the buzzer based on the tone no. assigned for the buzzer to play on the pressing the resp. button.

Different pull -down resistors(10kÎ© each) are connected to all buttons to weaken their connection with the ground wire to protect the input and the generated on pressing the button from static electricity.
This would be accomplished by uusing the logic that electricity travels on less -resisitive path, while we are providing a more resisitive path b/w the buttons & the ground . So connection would get weak there due to less electricity flow.
